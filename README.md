# ![logo](static/logo_icon.png) Poker app built with Svelte

## Technology stack

Introduce and motivate your chosen technology stack, and explain how it contributes to solving the business problem.

### Chosen frameworks

**Svelte**\
Why?

1. **Its the new kid on the block (2016)**\
   With the domination of React, Angular and Vue.js a new challenger has entered the area.
2. **Highest community score of all commonly used javascript frameworks**\
   With only `2%` of votes on a jetbrains community vote on "which JavaScript frameworks do you regularly use", svelte is a very underused framework. (https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2020/javascript/) Though in a 2020 state of JS survey, it received first place with a `89%`(!) satisfaction, interest, usage and awareness ration ranking. (https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/front-end-frameworks/)
3. **Performance oriented**
   - **No virtual dom**\
      Svelte uses an algorithm to generate native javascript functions that it needs to update the HTML Dom, thus substancially lowering the amount of re-renders performed on the UI.
     (https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead)
   - **True reactivity**\
      Reactivity is not handled via an API, but is built into the language itself and added during compile time. Thus eliminating the need of expensive API calls and the garbage collection which is a result. By simply prepending `$` you can make a statement reactive and svelte will recalculate and rerender state of the app accordingly.
     (https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-3-rethinking-reactivity)
   - **Lightweight framework size**\
      Svelte out of the box is `4.3kB`, which is very small in comparison to other frameworks like React, which is `128kB` (React + ReactDOM). Because of this, web applications load faster and bandwidth costs are lowered meaning faster page loads and app-like performance for the user.
4. **Easy to understand**
   - **HTML, CSS, JS**\
      Because svelte can be written in plain JavaScript, it has almost no learning curve for someone already familiar with the basics of web development and JavaScript.
   - **Speed up development**\
      The added benefit of svelte's slim learning curve, simplicity of syntax and the skinny amount of code, results in the development cycle speeding up by a fair margin.
