#### What went well:
 - 93.61% test coverage
 - Svelte(kit) develops quickly
 - Workable MVP!
 - Code quality, very nice and compact code with very little dependencies

#### (Even) better if:
- We keep on schedule and don't get stuck on the details

### What went well:
 - Implemented/ used 3 means of deployment; Self hosting, gitlab pages, external hosting via hosting company
 - implemented different type of databases; firebase/firestore (nosql database), MongoDB (nosql database)
 - wrote clean CRUD operations for firebase.
 - Injected seperated services (SocketIO, MongoDB) as "bundles" into sveltekit using VITE plugins.

### (Even) better if:
- Faster realisation when the current devops can be improved or needs overhaul. Can ben done by just using it extensivly, pushing it to it's limits. See where the limitations are and look for alternative tools to fix those limitations.
- Make more use of Typescript classes!

### Coach feedback: Auke
- Try to do more research towards devops, not automatically deployed. Why do certain things work the way they do.
- Do more unit tests
- Not really any code to show
